options:

- play [directly](http://clausreinke.github.com/playground/cross-and-circle), in a single browser window,

- download both index.html and server.js, start
  the latter via 'node server.js', and direct one
  or more browser windows to 'http://localhost:9000'.
  Moves made in any browser window will be replicated
  in all the others.
